        I struggled with this homework assignment! My computer started lagging intensely when I put more color changes in, so I could not focus on design.
      I'm not even sure if the shapes are showing up at the right time because when I pressed play my computer would freeze. It would eventually play but
      it glitched too much to see. I definitely will be trying again after class.
